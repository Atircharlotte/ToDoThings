## Project Overview

This is a to-do-lists app that users can write down their missions or something to do.
This application is built in React and create-react-app cml.

## Usage

1. Users can enter content inside the textbox. By playing "ADD MISSION" button, users can add new mission at the below section. The bootom of the website will display how many missions left.

2. If the mission is done, users can give the corresponding mission a check.

3. If the mission is deleted or checked, the number of missions left will changed automatically.

## Features

The records are stored in the localstorage of the browser. Accordingly, whole page will stay the same even users refresh the webpage. (But the page won't stay the same if cache is cleared.)
